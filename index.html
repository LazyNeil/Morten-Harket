                Morten Harket was born on September 14, 1959. He is a Norwegian musician, best known as the lead singer
                of the 80s synth-pop trio a-ha formed in Oslo in 1982.

                He started writing music and playing piano at the age of 4. At the age of 23 he formed a-ha with Magne
                Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy. In 1984 his band released their first single, "Take On Me" and it
                reached the top of the Billboard hit 100 next year.

                Harket released six solo albums and ten studio albums with a-ha to date.

                King Harald named Morten Harket, Magne Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy `Knight First Class of the
                Order
                of St. Olav` in 2012.

                He was featured in magazines, stories that dubbed him heart-throb <strong class="dance">(because he
                    is!)</strong> and asked him about his secret formula.

            He said:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/13916239/morten-harket-masked-singer-heartthrob/">

                    “I’ve always constantly been told you need to be careful with your skin and you need to do this and
                    that, and that the body is best if you keep putting a lot of stuff on to soften and moisten your
                    skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But your system will be confused because it reads the skin and what the skin needs, so I just leave
                    it
                    to
                    itself and it provides you with what you need usually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I think you need to back off with products. Perhaps my only advice is just to never remove
                    makeup
                    when
                    you’ve been on a TV show.”
